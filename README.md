# BEM-Project
I create this project to learn BEM and scss folder structure. Also I'm using a lot of methods to create with animations.

1. You need to install node_modules (npm install)
2. If you want to live your site just type in console: live-server
3. If you want compile scss just type in console: npm run compile:sass
